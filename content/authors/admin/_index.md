After a PhD in Inria Nancy Grand-Est entitled “alpha-stable process for signal processing”, Mathieu Fontaine started in October 2019 a Postdoc in RIKEN Artificial Intelligence Project (AIP) and became a guest at Kyoto University. His interests is mainly on audio signal processing including, but not limited, to speech enhancement, speaker separation, source localization and music source separation using heavy-tailed probabilistic models and/or deep bayesian networks.
